A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings.
There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement the Trie class:

1. Trie() Initializes the trie object.
2. void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
3. boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
4. boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

Why Tries over HashSet>>: HashCode of a string is based on length of a string, which means if a string has more length then searching that string will take time,
                        which we can assume for now as O(L) {length} i.e., Searching, Insertion, deletion, find in hashset is O(L) in avg or best case. 
                        But when lot of strings are there then, in worst case due to lot of strings which will lead us to lot of collisions.
                        So to get rid of that we have a new data structure called TRIE , which will also insert, delete and find string in O(L),
                        but it will also find prefixes also like if any string starts with 'APP', it can easliy tell in O(L). 
                        So conclusion is when we have lot of string(huge dataset) then we should go for Tries, else we can use HashSet.
                        The disadvantage of Trie over Hashset is that trie uses lot of extra spaces compared to HashSet.
                        >>> Space taken by all strings in trie is O(N*L), where N = number of strings and L is max length of string.
                        >>> time complexity  = O(L) for find, search, insert, prefix, delete in Trie.
